# PyBer Analysis
Module 5



**Overview of the analysis:** 

The purpose of this assignment was to analyze all the rideshare data from Pyber, a ride-sharing app. We created a line graph that showed the relationship between type of city (Rural, Urban, Suburban) and total fare between January and May of 2019. We can further analyze the line graph to see if city type has an impact on how often people use Pyber, as well as which months are more popular. 


**Results:**

When comparing city types we see that Urban cities spend the most on Pyber, with Rural cities spending the least. Suburban cities are in the middle of both. We see a similar peak in rides at the end of February for all city types. Urban and Suburban cities both spend more by the end of April than January. Rural cities, produce a steadier revenue flow and end April with the same numbers as they began the year. 

The total fares for Urban cities reaches a peak of $2,500 revenue in one day. The highest earnings in a day for Rural cities is $500. For Suburban cities, the highest day earnings was $1,500. This shows how different Urban cities are to Rural cities. This could be due to a higher population in Urban cities leds ot more customers - more people that need Pyber.

**Summary:**

Based on the results, there are a few options Pyber can take to increase their revenue. Marketing towards Suburban cities would tap into an already active community. Spending resources marketing Rural cities might not be useful because those cities have a low interest in using Pyber compared to other city types. Urban cities already use Pyber so there's no need to market towards them.  Another recomendation is to further study the peak days people use Pyber and seeing if they coincide with a national holiday. All city types seemed to have a similar peak on the same day in February. Pyber can provide a special discount to entice more customers. One last recommendation to increase revenue would be to research how to tap into Rural cities. They spend the lowest among all city types. It would be smart to do some research and try to figure out if there are any ways Rural cities can rely on Pyber more. Perhaps provide grocery delivery services to homes that are very rural.
