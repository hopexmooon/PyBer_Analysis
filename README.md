# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5



**Overview of the analysis:** 

The purpose of this assignment was to analyze all the rideshare data from Pyber, a ride-sharing app. We created a line graph that showed the relationship between type of city (Rural, Urban, Suburban) and total fare between January and May of 2019. We can further analyze the line graph to see if city type has an impact on how often people use Pyber, as well as which months are more popular. 


**Results:**

When comparing city types we see that Urban cities spend the most on Pyber, with Rural cities spending the least. Suburban cities are in the middle of both. We see a similar peak in rides at the end of February for all city types. Urban and Suburban cities both spend more by the end of April than January. Rural cities, produce a steadier revenue flow and end April with the same numbers as they began the year.

 Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.
